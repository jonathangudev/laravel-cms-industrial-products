// We are following a pattern called ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS). ITCSS's
// concept is based mainly around layering on styles based on their reach within
// the DOM. We are also using this in combination with BEM and name spacing.

// Generic, far-reaching, low specificity styles are declared first:

// Settings: Global variables, config switches.
@import 'styles/01-settings/index';

// Tools: Default mixins and functions.
@import 'styles/02-tools/index';

// Vendor: Third party self contained styles.
@import 'styles/03-vendor/index';

// Generic: Ground-zero styles (resets, box-sizing).
@import 'styles/04-generic/index';

// Elements: Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors).
@import 'styles/05-elements/index';

// Objects: Cosmetic-free design patterns.
@import 'styles/06-objects/index';

// Components: Designed components, chunks of UI.
@import 'styles/07-components/index';

// Trumps: Utilities and Helper classes with the ability to override everything
// and anything with an !important or that uses an ID for a selector
@import 'styles/08-trumps/index';

// Explicit, localised, higher specificity styles are declared last.
